# Angle Wiki

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2.

## This is a Starter Project!
I needed to setup some Wiki sites for my work and i did not like the stuff i saw.
i wanted something that would be easy to work with and our other projects all use Angular CLI.

So I looked around and saw that most of the main parts are out on GitHub and the main thing was to put them together in a project.

I am using multiple components that i will list out later, each has been a good fit and done much of the work.

if you take this code you will need to make a set of server side services to handle the page content, table of pages, list of wiki's
and files for images or dovument file links, from the angular services you can create your own.
i will add some notes in here on what i used.

i am not trying to make this a ready to run app, if you want to do that feel free to use this as a base.
if you see some general items that can make this starter better i will be happy to allow folks to contribute.
